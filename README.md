## Hosting on Netlify

1. Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) if you don't have one
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Customizing Your Domain

Both GitHub Pages and Netlify allow you to use a custom domain:

2. Configure the DNS settings as instructed by GitHub or Netlify
3. Add the custom domain in your hosting platform settings
